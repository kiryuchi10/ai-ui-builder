# AI-Powered UI Builder

## Objective
Develop a full-stack AI-powered application that:
- Automates UI design workflows by integrating ChatGPT with Figma (via MCP).
- Generates wireframes and converts them into React + Tailwind components.
- Provides a FastAPI backend for business logic and PostgreSQL database for storage.
- Implements CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Planned Features
- **Frontend:** React (Vite) + TailwindCSS for modern UI
- **Backend:** FastAPI with CORS and dotenv for env management
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **AI Integration:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Figma automation
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for build, test, deployment
- **Security:** .env for sensitive data, proper .gitignore rules

## Branching Strategy
- main → Production-ready code
- develop → Integration of all features
- feature/* → Individual feature branches
- release/* → Pre-production testing
- hotfix/* → Urgent production fixes

## Next Steps
- Initialize Git branches (main, develop, feature/*)
- Setup frontend structure and Tailwind configuration
- Setup backend with FastAPI and PostgreSQL
- Add CI/CD pipeline for deployment
